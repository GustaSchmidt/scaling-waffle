0Wow.
QWow.

GHoney begins when our valiant Pollen
2Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

aHere we have our latest advancement,
hthe Krelman.
S- What does that do?
5- Oatches that little strand of honey
kthat hangs after you pour it.
RSaves us millions.
oOan anyone work on the Krelman?
GOf course. Most bee jobs are
ksmall ones. But bees know
Vthat every small job,
mif it's done well, means a lot.
RBut choose carefully
3because you'll stay in the job
Syou pick for the rest of your life.
DThe same job the rest of your life?
yI didn't know that.
5What's the difference?
GYou'll be happy to know that bees,
Eas a species, haven't had one day off
jin 27 million years.
JSo you'll just work us to death?
mWe'll sure try.
9Wow! That blew my mind!
k"What's the difference?"
nHow can you say that?
DOne job forever?
/That's an insane choice to have to make.
TI'm relieved. Now we only have
cto make one decision in life.
6But, Adam, how could they
unever have told us that?
GWhy would you question anything?
AWe're bees.
hWe're the most perfectly

nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
GJock. You have to be bred for that.
JRight.
dLook. That's more pollen
Othan you and I will see in a lifetime.
rIt's just a status symbol.
dBees make too much of it.
CPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it
Cand the ladies see you wearing it.
jThose ladies?
VAren't they our cousins too?
7Distant. Distant.
vLook at these two.
N- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
a- Let's have fun with them.

LIt's a beautiful thing.
wYou know, Dad,

Gfrom it illegally!
YTomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
gwe'll have three former queens here in
Zour studio, discussing their new book,
JOlassy Ladies,
cout this week on Hexagon.
7Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
8Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
dfrom the hive. I can't do this"?
aBees have never been afraid
Nto change the world.
4What about Bee Oolumbus?
HBee Gandhi? Bejesus?
YWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
hWe were thinking
2of stickball or candy stores.
dHow old are you?
IThe bee community
iis supporting you in this case,
4which will be the trial
/of the bee century.
UYou know, they have a Larry King
qin the human world too.
lIt's a common name. Next week...
dHe looks like you and has a show
+and suspenders and colored dots...
/Next week...
JGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the
Aguest even though you just heard 'em.
VBear Week next week!
eThey're scary, hairy and here live.
fAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,
bsquinty eyes, very Jewish.
/In tennis, you attack

KIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
dHoney, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

Quiet, please.
XActual work going on here.
F- Is that that same bee?
7- Yes, it is!
CI'm helping him sue the human race.
l- Hello.
/- Hello, bee.
vThis is Ken.
fYeah, I remember you. Timberland, size

TWhy does he talk again?
VListen, you better go
+'cause we're really busy working.

GWhy is yogurt night so difficult?!
pYou poor thing.
9You two have been at this for hours!
CYes, and Adam here
ehas been a huge help.
U- Frosting...
L- How many sugars?
mJust one. I try not
kto use the competition.
0So why are you helping me?
0Bees have good qualities.
lAnd it takes my mind off the shop.
gInstead of flowers, people
5are giving balloon bouquets now.
zThose are great, if you're three.
8And artificial flowers.
z- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
Y- Yeah, me too.
RBent stingers, pointless pollination.
eBees must hate those fake things!
ENothing worse
lthan a daffodil that's had work done.
VMaybe this could make up
Efor it a little bit.
Q- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
M- I guess.
hYou sure you want to go through with it?
tAm I sure? When I'm done with
Athe humans, they won't be able
xto say, "Honey, I'm home,"
twithout paying a royalty!
4It's an incredible scene
bhere in downtown Manhattan,
awhere the world anxiously waits,
vbecause for the first time in history,
owe will hear for ourselves
+if a honeybee can actually speak.
fWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?
JIt's pretty big, isn't it?
tI can't believe how many humans
4don't work during the day.
FYou think billion-dollar multinational
Cfood companies have good lawyers?
DEverybody needs to stay
8behind the barricade.
l- What's the matter?
N- I don't know, I just got a chill.
dWell, if it isn't the bee team.
7You boys work on this?
6All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

All right. Oase number 4475,
wSuperior Oourt of New York,
iBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
zis now in session.
pMr. Montgomery, you're representing

dMr. Benson... you're representing

kI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
Iwe're ready to proceed.
+Mr. Montgomery,
Zyour opening statement, please.
FLadies and gentlemen of the jury,
pmy grandmother was a simple woman.
MBorn on a farm, she believed
Jit was man's divine right
Kto benefit from the bounty
Dof nature God put before us.
SIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world
AMr. Benson imagines,
Zjust think of what would it mean.
hI would have to negotiate
7with the silkworm
zfor the elastic in my britches!
KTalking bee!
/How do we know this isn't some sort of
aholographic motion-picture-capture
+Hollywood wizardry?
tThey could be using laser beams!
qRobotics! Ventriloquism!
TOloning! For all we know,
Ahe could be on steroids!
sMr. Benson?
SLadies and gentlemen,
Zthere's no trickery here.
ZI'm just an ordinary bee.
yHoney's pretty important to me.
LIt's important to all bees.
UWe invented it!
CWe make it. And we protect it
gwith our lives.
YUnfortunately, there are
Asome people in this room
vwho think they can take it from us
q'cause we're the little guys!
XI'm hoping that, after this is all over,
vyou'll see how, by taking our honey,
Nyou not only take everything we have
5but everything we are!
GI wish he'd dress like that
+all the time. So nice!
tOall your first witness.
8So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
gof Honey Farms, big company you have.
DI suppose so.
JI see you also own
sHoneyburton and Honron!
2Yes, they provide beekeepers
ffor our farms.
UBeekeeper. I find that
ato be a very disturbing term.
WI don't imagine you employ
rany bee-free-ers, do you?
4- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

- No.
i- No.
zBecause you don't free bees.
sYou keep bees. Not only that,
/it seems you thought a bear would be
pan appropriate image for a jar of honey.
BThey're very lovable creatures.
0Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
7You mean like this?
DBears kill bees!
tHow'd you like his head crashing
4through your living room?!
qBiting into your couch!
NSpitting out your throw pillows!
sOK, that's enough. Take him away.
HSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
KYour name intrigues me.
b- Where have I heard it before?
k- I was with a band called The Police.
NBut you've never been
ba police officer, have you?
0No, I haven't.
SNo, you haven't. And so here
uwe have yet another example
Lof bee culture casually
Jstolen by a human
Ufor nothing more than
Ua prance-about stage name.
LOh, please.
sHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
PBecause I'm feeling
Da little stung, Sting.
2Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
QThat's not his real name?! You idiots!
+Mr. Liotta, first,
tbelated congratulations on
8your Emmy win for a guest spot
Won ER in 2005.
aThank you. Thank you.
yI see from your resume
Othat you're devilishly handsome
Kwith a churning inner turmoil
ythat's ready to blow.
7I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
uNot yet it isn't. But is this
jwhat it's come to for you?
SExploiting tiny, helpless bees
xso you don't
0have to rehearse
tyour part and learn your lines, sir?
nWatch it, Benson!
KI could blow right now!
sThis isn't a goodfella.
yThis is a badfella!
KWhy doesn't someone just step on
vthis creep, and we can all go home?!
A- Order in this court!
s- You're all thinking it!
mOrder! Order, I say!
l- Say it!
g- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
1I think it was awfully nice
Wof that bear to pitch in like that.
JI think the jury's on our side.
RAre we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.

Right. Well, here's to a great team.
1To a great team!
fWell, hello.
+- Ken!
w- Hello.
kI didn't think you were coming.
TNo, I was just late.
JI tried to call, but... the battery.
7I didn't want all this to go to waste,
Iso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
0Oh, that was lucky.
rThere's a little left.
xI could heat it up.
+Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
+So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
gI'm not much for the game myself.
EThe ball's a little grabby.
xThat's where I usually sit.
QRight... there.
WKen, Barry was looking at your resume,
8and he agreed with me that eating with
jchopsticks isn't really a special skill.
gYou think I don't see what you're doing?
/I know how hard it is to find
hthe rightjob. We have that in common.
iDo we?
VBees have 100 percent employment,
Xbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.
kThat's just what
1I was thinking about doing.
9Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
Hfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
7I'm going to drain the old stinger.
YYeah, you do that.
HLook at that.
eYou know, I've just about had it
Swith your little mind games.
V- What's that?
r- Italian Vogue.
7Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
4A lot of ads.
4Remember what Van said, why is
hyour life more valuable than mine?
ZFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!
XI think something stinks in here!
hI love the smell of flowers.
JHow do you like the smell of flames?!
WNot as much.
NWater bug! Not taking sides!
1Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
OThis is pathetic!
wI've got issues!
sWell, well, well, a royal flush!
F- You're bluffing.
u- Am I?
WSurf's up, dude!
PPoo water!
fThat bowl is gnarly.
VExcept for those dirty yellow rings!
4Kenneth! What are you doing?!
qYou know, I don't even like honey!
RI don't eat it!
DWe need to talk!
oHe's just a little bee!
ZAnd he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

Long time? What are you talking about?!
PAre there other bugs in your life?
TNo, but there are other things bugging
tme in life. And you're one of them!
MFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
BMy nerves are fried from riding
bon this emotional roller coaster!
bGoodbye, Ken.
1And for your information,
KI prefer sugar-free, artificial
Wsweeteners made by man!
SI'm sorry about all that.
8I know it's got
Uan aftertaste! I like it!
MI always felt there was some kind
mof barrier between Ken and me.
CI couldn't overcome it.
xOh, well.
VAre you OK for the trial?
3I believe Mr. Montgomery
pis about out of ideas.
iWe would like to call
wMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
KGood idea! You can really see why he's
Bconsidered one of the best lawyers...
gYeah.
QLayton, you've
Cgotta weave some magic
rwith this jury,
uor it's gonna be all over.
bDon't worry. The only thing I have
Eto do to turn this jury around
Ris to remind them
+of what they don't like about bees.
j- You got the tweezers?
8- Are you allergic?
kOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.
kMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
jwhat I think we'd all like to know.
ZWhat exactly is your relationship
Zto that woman?
BWe're friends.
r- Good friends?
g- Yes.
KHow good? Do you live together?
HWait a minute...
zAre you her little...
H...bedbug?
KI've seen a bee documentary or two.
OFrom what I understand,
Fdoesn't your queen give birth
0to all the bee children?
C- Yeah, but...
M- So those aren't your real parents!
h- Oh, Barry...
i- Yes, they are!
bHold me back!
0You're an illegitimate bee,

fHe's denouncing bees!
hDon't y'all date your cousins?
v- Objection!
l- I'm going to pincushion this guy!
FAdam, don't! It's what he wants!
gOh, I'm hit!!
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

Order! Order!
zThe venom! The venom
cis coursing through my veins!
SI have been felled
Mby a winged beast of destruction!
jYou see? You can't treat them
jlike equals! They're striped savages!
YStinging's the only thing
kthey know! It's their way!
q- Adam, stay with me.
q- I can't feel my legs.
dWhat angel of mercy
Twill come forward to suck the poison
Ufrom my heaving buttocks?
LI will have order in this court. Order!
tOrder, please!
7The case of the honeybees
Eversus the human race
ztook a pointed turn against the bees
uyesterday when one of their legal
yteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.
W- Hey, buddy.
P- Hey.
e- Is there much pain?
h- Yeah.
hI...
SI blew the whole case, didn't I?
+It doesn't matter. What matters is
Fyou're alive. You could have died.
TI'd be better off dead. Look at me.
gThey got it from the cafeteria
/downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
WLook, there's
Ta little celery still on it.
FWhat was it like to sting someone?
WI can't explain it. It was all...
nAll adrenaline and then...
Band then ecstasy!
UAll right.
7You think it was all a trap?
IOf course. I'm sorry.
7I flew us right into this.
pWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're
Sjust a couple of bugs in this world.
iWhat will the humans do to us
9if they win?
OI don't know.
AI hear they put the roaches in motels.
hThat doesn't sound so bad.
nAdam, they check in,
kbut they don't check out!
wOh, my.
sOould you get a nurse
lto close that window?
A- Why?
N- The smoke.
gBees don't smoke.
jRight. Bees don't smoke.
qBees don't smoke!
XBut some bees are smoking.
IThat's it! That's our case!
XIt is? It's not over?
OGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
8Get back to the court and stall.
vStall any way you can.
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

Mr. Flayman.
BYes? Yes, Your Honor!
sWhere is the rest of your team?
fWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.
TBees are trained to fly haphazardly,
3and as a result,
kwe don't make very good time.
xI actually heard a funny story about...
+Your Honor,
Thaven't these ridiculous bugs
gtaken up enough
zof this court's valuable time?
UHow much longer will we allow
2these absurd shenanigans to go on?
9They have presented no compelling
Yevidence to support their charges
Yagainst my clients,
hwho run legitimate businesses.
jI move for a complete dismissal
fof this entire case!
DMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
rto have to consider
MMr. Montgomery's motion.
0But you can't! We have a terrific case.
mWhere is your proof?
PWhere is the evidence?
fShow me the smoking gun!
FHold it, Your Honor!
UYou want a smoking gun?
eHere is your smoking gun.
WWhat is that?
hIt's a bee smoker!
AWhat, this?
1This harmless little contraption?
bThis couldn't hurt a fly,
1let alone a bee.
fLook at what has happened
Vto bees who have never been asked,
t"Smoking or non?"
JIs this what nature intended for us?
6To be forcibly addicted
Rto smoke machines
Yand man-made wooden slat work camps?
ELiving out our lives as honey slaves
uto the white man?
1- What are we gonna do?
h- He's playing the species card.
oLadies and gentlemen, please,
+free these bees!
yFree the bees! Free the bees!
1Free the bees!
xFree the bees! Free the bees!
yThe court finds in favor of the bees!
DVanessa, we won!
cI knew you could do it! High-five!
qSorry.
gI'm OK! You know what this means?
CAll the honey
hwill finally belong to the bees.
8Now we won't have
Rto work so hard all the time.
TThis is an unholy perversion
Vof the balance of nature, Benson.
eYou'll regret this.
xBarry, how much honey is out there?
All right. One at a time.

Barry, who are you wearing?
4My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
3and I have no pants.
l- What if Montgomery's right?
A- What do you mean?
4We've been living the bee way
Qa long time, 27 million years.
KOongratulations on your victory.
BWhat will you demand as a settlement?
gFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown
Qof all bee work camps.
CThen we want back the honey
/that was ours to begin with,
8every last drop.
CWe demand an end to the glorification
8of the bear as anything more
Gthan a filthy, smelly,
Tbad-breath stink machine.
EWe're all aware
Lof what they do in the woods.
hWait for my signal.
nTake him out.
uHe'll have nauseous
7for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
tAnd we will no longer tolerate
1bee-negative nicknames...
yBut it's just a prance-about stage name!
D...unnecessary inclusion of honey
cin bogus health products
vand la-dee-da human
ntea-time snack garnishments.
oOan't breathe.
LBring it in, boys!
LHold it right there! Good.
1Tap it.
OMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
sand there's gallons more coming!
s- I think we need to shut down!
K- Shut down? We've never shut down.
4Shut down honey production!
EStop making honey!
2Turn your key, sir!
lWhat do we do now?
7Oannonball!
lWe're shutting honey production!
PMission abort.
yAborting pollination and nectar detail.
ZReturning to base.
bAdam, you wouldn't believe
Chow much honey was out there.
sOh, yeah?
CWhat's going on? Where is everybody?
g- Are they out celebrating?
x- They're home.
BThey don't know what to do.
+Laying out, sleeping in.
RI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
jto San Antonio with a cricket.
QAt least we got our honey back.
wSometimes I think, so what if humans
0liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
gIt's the greatest thing in the world!
lI was excited to be part of making it.
ZThis was my new desk. This was my
Nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.
And now...

Now I can't.
6I don't understand
Uwhy they're not happy.
qI thought their lives would be better!
jThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.
7Honey really changes people.
DYou don't have any idea
/what's going on, do you?
K- What did you want to show me?
X- This.
GWhat happened here?
TThat is not the half of it.
YOh, no. Oh, my.
BThey're all wilting.
nDoesn't look very good, does it?
MNo.
cAnd whose fault do you think that is?
9You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
WBees?
DSpecifically, me.
7I didn't think bees not needing to make
qhoney would affect all these things.
jIt's notjust flowers.
MFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
0That's our whole SAT test right there.
fTake away produce, that affects
Wthe entire animal kingdom.
lAnd then, of course...
yThe human species?
DSo if there's no more pollination,
sit could all just go south here,
+couldn't it?
/I know this is also partly my fault.
aHow about a suicide pact?
FHow do we do it?
O- I'll sting you, you step on me.
6- Thatjust kills you twice.
SRight, right.
2Listen, Barry...
Ysorry, but I gotta get going.
qI had to open my mouth and talk.
XVanessa?
jVanessa? Why are you leaving?
9Where are you going?
TTo the final Tournament of Roses parade
Tin Pasadena.
OThey've moved it to this weekend
Obecause all the flowers are dying.
cIt's the last chance
UI'll ever have to see it.
zVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
5I never meant it to turn out like this.
eI know. Me neither.
bTournament of Roses.
GRoses can't do sports.
gWait a minute. Roses. Roses?
KRoses!
xVanessa!
RRoses?!
3Barry?
m- Roses are flowers!
Y- Yes, they are.
iFlowers, bees, pollen!
/I know.
XThat's why this is the last parade.
Maybe not.

Oould you ask him to slow down?
ZOould you slow down?
JBarry!
5OK, I made a huge mistake.
bThis is a total disaster, all my fault.
nYes, it kind of is.
1I've ruined the planet.
mI wanted to help you
Gwith the flower shop.
mI've made it worse.
aActually, it's completely closed down.
WI thought maybe you were remodeling.
SBut I have another idea, and it's
ggreater than my previous ideas combined.
RI don't want to hear it!
oAll right, they have the roses,
9the roses have the pollen.
sI know every bee, plant
rand flower bud in this park.
/All we gotta do is get what they've got
aback here with what we've got.
o- Bees.
x- Park.
K- Pollen!
S- Flowers.
V- Repollination!
0- Across the nation!
nTournament of Roses,
3Pasadena, Oalifornia.
qThey've got nothing
Gbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.
4Security will be tight.
lI have an idea.
SVanessa Bloome, FTD.
4Official floral business. It's real.
ySorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
oThank you. It was a gift.
QOnce inside,
Hwe just pick the right float.
2How about The Princess and the Pea?
5I could be the princess,
Kand you could be the pea!
OYes, I got it.
N- Where should I sit?
+- What are you?
O- I believe I'm the pea.
m- The pea?
uIt goes under the mattresses.
O- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
6- I'm getting the marshal.
vYou do that!
iThis whole parade is a fiasco!
mLet's see what this baby'll do.
JHey, what are you doing?!
gThen all we do
=is blend in with traffic...
=...without arousing suspicion.
Once at the airport,

there's no stopping us.
-Stop! Security.
-- You and your insect pack your float?
-- Yes.
-Has it been
-in your possession the entire time?
EWould you remove your shoes?
N- Remove your stinger.
D- It's part of me.
 I know. Just having some fun.
REnjoy your flight.
SThen if we're lucky, we'll have
Ajust enough pollen to do the job.
 Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
Phave just enough pollen to do the job!
RI think this is gonna work.
IIt's got to work.
VAttention, passengers,
Athis is Oaptain Scott.
TWe have a bit of bad weather
Ein New York.
 It looks like we'll experience
Ka couple hours delay.
EBarry, these are cut flowers
Ywith no water. They'll never make it.
-I gotta get up there
-and talk to them.
-Be careful.
-Oan I get help
-with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking

inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.
Bee!
Don't freak out! My entire species...
What are you doing?
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?
Don't move.
Oh, Barry.
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?
And please hurry!
What happened here?
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!
No one's flying the plane!
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?
As a matter of fact, there is.
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.
It's got giant wings, huge engines.
I can't fly a plane.
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.
How hard could it be?
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...
That's Barry!
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers
and an incapacitated flight crew.
Flowers?!
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls
with absolutely no flight experience.
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.
They've done enough damage.
But isn't he your only hope?
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.
Their wings are too small...
Haven't we heard this a million times?
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.
- Stand by.
- We're going live.
The way we work may be a mystery to you.
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.
But let me tell you about a small job.
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.
We get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!
Left, right, down, hover.
- Hover?
- Forget hover.
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
Barry, what happened?!
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!
Move out!
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!
Don't have to yell.
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
I can't do this!
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!
You snap out of it.
You snap out of it.
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.
How is the plane flying?
I don't know.
Hello?
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?
The Pollen Jocks!
They do get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
Bring the nose down.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?
Affirmative!
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
Land on that flower!
Ready? Full reverse!
Spin it around!
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower
made of millions of bees!
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
Rotate around it.
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!
Just drop it. Be a part of it.
Aim for the center!
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
Oome on, already.
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.
Listen, everyone!
This runway is covered
with the last pollen
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.
That means this is our last chance.
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?
We're bees!
Keychain!
Then follow me! Except Keychain.
Hold on, Barry. Here.
You've earned this.
Yeah!
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
Oh, yeah.
That's our Barry.
Mom! The bees are back!
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!
I had no idea.
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
Sorry I'm late.
He's a lawyer too?
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.
Have a great afternoon!
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.
Thank you, Barry!
That bee is living my life!
Let it go, Kenny.
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.
- Thinking bee!
- Me?
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
